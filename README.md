# Generation of flexure patterns

The source code from my Master Thesis June 2018

The code can generate units and continous patterns.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
The code requires
* Python >=2.7
* shapely >=1.6
* numpy
* matplotlib

Windows users have two good installation options: the wheels at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely and the Anaconda platform's conda-forge channel.

OS X and Linux users can get Shapely wheels with GEOS included from the Python Package Index with a recent version of pip (8+):

```
$ pip install shapely
```

A few extra speedups that require Numpy can be had by running

```
$ pip install shapely[vectorized]
```
Shapely is available via system package management tools like apt, yum, and Homebrew, and is also provided by popular Python distributions like Canopy and Anaconda.



### Installing patternGeneratorsClass
By copying this repository, the code be runned from any Python IDE.
